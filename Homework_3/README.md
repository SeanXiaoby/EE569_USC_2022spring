#### :warning: Image files name specifications:
The codes default that the image names are as same as those given to us to test our codes. Therefore, no interfaces are left to get the image files names from the commond lines.

#### :warning: Files directory specifications:
Please put all the images and the ground truth .mat files in the same folder with the source codes files. The pre-trained Structured Edge models are put in the edge-master folder and you can leave it be.
